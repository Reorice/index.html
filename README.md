# Project Name
Valkyrie Website
## Design Process
I originally wanted to make a website that was very similar to the official webstie that compiled all the data of the characters, but then decided it was too much and decided to stick to this unit called 'Valkyrie'. I chose the website colors based off the color schemes of the unit and made sure the colors did not clash. I also chose a font, Libre Baskerville, that I thought would best suit the unit's theme. The font is kept standard throughout the website, with one in italics as it is a quote.
