# Project Name
Valkyrie Website
## Design Process
I originally wanted to make a website that was very similar to the official webstie that compiled all the data of the characters, but then decided it was too much and decided to stick to this unit called 'Valkyrie'. I chose the website colors based off the color schemes of the unit and made sure the colors did not clash. I also chose a font, Libre Baskerville, that I thought would best suit the unit's theme. The font is kept standard throughout the website, with one in italics as it is a quote.
## Features
Some notable features are a fixed navigation bar, which is also a responsive navigation bar. A small introduction, with no spoilers, of the unit. Two float containers that contain the personal information of the unit's characters. An image gallery that showcases some of the card art and outfits of the characters. And finally, a table of the unit's discography, with corresponding years of the albums' release.
## Technologies used
I used a total of 3 techs, consisting of HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

HTML is the skeleton of the website
CSS is used to give the website color
JavaScript is used to animate the website and the image gallery
